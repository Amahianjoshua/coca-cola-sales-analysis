# 🥤 Coca-Cola Sales & Operating Profit Analysis (Python Edition)

This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of Coca-Cola’s beverage sales and operating profit across various U.S. retailers, states, and time periods using Python. The analysis aims to extract actionable business insights using widely adopted Python data libraries.

## 📌 Overview

The dataset contains real-world performance metrics across:

- 🛒 U.S. **Retailers** (e.g., Walmart, CVS)  
- 🗺️ **States** and **Geographic Regions**  
- 🧃 **Beverage Brands** (e.g., Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Dasani, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade)
