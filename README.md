# 🥤 Coca-Cola Sales & Profit Analysis – 🐍 Python + 📊 Power BI

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of Coca-Cola’s beverage sales and operating profit across various U.S. retailers, states, and time periods using 🐍 **Python** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and 📊 **Power BI** for interactive visualization. The goal is to extract actionable business insights by combining the analytical power of Python with the storytelling capabilities of Power BI.

## 📌 Overview

The dataset contains real-world performance metrics across:

- 🛒 U.S. **Retailers** (e.g., Walmart, CVS)  
- 🗺️ **States** and **Geographic Regions**  
- 🧃 **Beverage Brands** (e.g., Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Dasani, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade)  
- 💰 **Operating Profit** and **Units Sold**  
- 📅 **Monthly and Seasonal Trends**

> **Note:** In this project, **"Coca-Cola"** refers specifically to the **classic cola beverage (Coca-Cola Classic)** and is treated as a distinct brand from others like Diet Coke or Sprite, though they are all owned by The Coca-Cola Company.

## ❓ Business Questions Explored

1. What are the top 3 beverage brands by total units sold?
2. Which U.S. regions generate the highest operating profit?
3. Which 5 cities contribute most to sales and profit?
4. How do sales and profits trend throughout the year?
5. How does each brand perform based on operating margin?
